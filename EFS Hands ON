EFS HANDS On

I have creates a Security group for EFS (EFS-sg) with inbound rule selected as NFS & my current EC2 security group

I have created EFS with basic options

then I have created a accesspoint

We create EFS Access Points to provide application-specific access, enforce permissions, and isolate data when multiple workloads share the same EFS file system. 

while creating access points I have used my EFS-SG there



then I have used AWS EFS documentation and mounted my efs to my server

here I installed pre reqs
sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils


after that i have seen tha option like

Automatically mounting file systems
Existing EC2 Linux instances

there I choose how to Update the /etc/fstab file with accesspoint option

To automatically mount a file system using an EFS access point, add the following line to the /etc/fstab file.

file-system-id:/ efs-mount-point efs _netdev,noresvport,tls,accesspoint=access-point-id 0 0
fs-07795e0b930a13444:/ /var/www/html/images efs _netdev,noresvport,tls,accesspoint=fsap-0600e702c2a921617 0 0

I have updated this on linux with vim /etc/fstab

then I used mount -a command to mount 

now my server connected to EFS not a local storage.
